## Introduction 
"The Lorien Legacies" by Pittacus Lore is one of my favorite book series. The dedicated fan website for the series recently went down, and I wanted to create my own fan website which consolidates trivia from the series and fun features like a series based quiz in the likes of a "Harry Potter" house sorting quiz. I used this opportunity to pick up new skills in web development like learning JQuery and responsive design using Bootstrap 4 and CSS media queries. Altogether, this project is a 4-page celebration of an amazing book series.

### Character List page
The character page has 4 different buttons representing the groups that all the characters in the series fall under. Clicking on one of these buttons opens up a list of characters and their descriptions for that group. Some character descriptions mention other characters that are within the page. Clicking on these mentioned names will scroll the user to the correct character and flash their description, opening and closing sections if nessecary.

### Books in Series page
The books page shows covers of each book in the series. Clicking on a picture will open a popup which displays information and quotes for that specific book. The popup has a gradient animation background for styling.

### Legacy Quiz page
The quiz page makes use of CSS display styling to create an immersive experience. For example, the background of the page will change based on which legacy the user is assigned from the quiz. JS functions are used to keep track of the user's answers and which questions, options, and images are displayed, making the quiz offline accesible and easy to take without endless scrolling through questions!
